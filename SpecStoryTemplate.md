# Spec Note : Story #X - *XXX*

>Describe the project in 2 lines or less. By “line” I mean the default reading width of your medium (e.g., Google Docs, wiki, text file) on a desktop client. Sticking to limits is critical for readability.

***

## Problem
>I highly recommend bullets for readability. Use bold words to quickly convey the gist of each point, and limit bullets to 2-3 lines. I prefer numbered lists so one can refer to a point verbally.

## Goals
>Make sure one can point to a goal and easily answer “did we hit it?”. Make clear promises.

## Out of scope
>This is your chance to eliminate bad assumptions and correctly set expectations.

## Context
>Use this section to provide supporting evidence for your problem and proposal. (Use-cases, Metrics, Competitor's solution, Survey results)

### Use-cases
1. XXX wants to ...
2. YYY wants to ...

### Assumptions

***

## Proposal
>Describe your proposal in the most natural way you can. Break it up into sections, and give it a clear narrative flow. Depending on the project, you may also add: wireframes, user flow diagrams, form inputs/validations, data models… all the specifics needed to execute the plan.

### Solution
### User Experience
### Success Criteria
### Tests
### Reports
### Future work

***

## People and Roles
>Help everyone know who is involved, and what is expected of them. Only include people who have authority to veto/approve decisions, or people who will execute on the plan.


## Tasks & Timelines
>Estimates must come from the builders (dev, design, etc.).
